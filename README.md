An Interpreter for the SILLY (Simple, Interpreted, Limited Language for You) built in CSC 533: Programming Languages at Creighton University

A bare-bones interpreter was provided by Dave Reed which I then modified and added to for various assignments.
The classes I created or modified are as follows:

Assignment.java, 
ConstantDeclaration.java, 
Expression.java, 
If.java, 
Local.java, 
MemorySpace.java, 
Repeat.java, 
Scope.java, 
Subcall.java, 
SubDec.java
