An Interpreter built in CSC 533: Programming Languages at Creighton University

A bare-bones interpreter was given to us by my professor, Dave Reed.
The classes I created or modified are as follows:

Assignment.java
ConstantDeclaration.java
Expression.java
If.java
Local.java
MemorySpace.java
Repeat.java
Scope.java
Subcall.java
SubDec.java
